## About
Welcome to my game development portfolio! Over the past 5+ years, I've created projects that focus on gameplay mechanics, AI behavior, and physics simulations. My goal is to transition into professional game development and continue to build innovative games.

# <u>Projects</u>

## Unity Projects (All in the Unity_Projects branch)

### **1. Moon Swinger**
- This was a personal project in Unity and is a small mobile game.
- The game is an infinite-runner game that involves an astronaut (the player) swinging through a cave on the moon while dodging obstacles.
- This game was never released, but it showcases my early skills using the Unity engine.
- I may pick up on the game as a future personal project.

### **2. The Hospital**
- This was my first real project in Unity. I was in high school and made it for my FBLA TN school club.
- This game is a horror game that incorporates quizzes to relate to the FBLA club.
- We won first place in the state of TN and got to compete in Nationals in San Antonio.

### **3. Hopper**
- This is a personal project being made in Unity that is going to be a 2D procedurally generated planet-exploring game.
- This game is currently in development, but it is on hold so I can work on a smaller project first.
- Functional features include player movement and random, procedural planet generation. This is probably the biggest project I have worked on.
- This game was never released, but it does showcase my experienced skills using the Unity engine.
- I may pick up on the game as a future personal project.

### **4. Untitled Tower Game**
- This is a personal project being made in Unity. This is the project I am currently working on. It currently does not have a name yet.
- The goal is to build a very tall tower using random items given to you, the player. You can get more items to build your tower, and as you build higher and higher, you can find floating islands.
- You will need to balance, stack, and climb your way to the top of the world.
- It is a smaller project that gives me a break from working on Hopper. Hopper took a lot of energy and time, so I decided to work on this game as it has a smaller scope.

# <u>School Projects (All in the College_Projects branch)</u>

### **1. Command line Chess made using C**
- This project was made for my Data Structures and Algorithms course at Cumberland University.
- It was written in C and has a person vs person (locally on the same PC), person vs computer, and a computer vs computer mode.
- The computer player's logic is very basic.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects branch.

### **2. NPC Character Behavior in Computer Games (Senior Capstone Project)**
- This project was made as my Senior Capstone project. This project focused on non-player characters and different ways to implement and cultivate their behaviors.
- This project includes a 71-page paper on the subject with programming projects as included at the end.
- This project includes a Unity project showing the A* pathfinding algorithm, a basic Python script showing finite-state machines, and a 3D Unity prototype showing NPC movement.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects branch.
  
### **3. Finite-State Machine Python Script for Senior Capstone**
- This project was made as my Senior Capstone project. It showcases basic finite-state machines using an NPC that changes states depending on player interactions.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects branch called iirizarry_FSM-Project.py.

### **4. Sorting Algorithm time complexity differences**
- This project was made for my Data Structures and Algorithms course at Cumberland University.
- The program displays the time differences of different sorting algorithms at different list lengths.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects called iirizarry_IT201_04-11-21_Sorting_Project9_v5.0.py.

### **5. Dijkstra's Algorithm in a table and forwarding table Python Script**
- This project was made for my Computer Networking course at Cumberland University.
- The objective is to display the steps to complete Dijkstra's algorithm in a table and in a forwarding table for a given graph.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects called iirizarry_IT325_11-3-21_Dijkstra_Algorithm_v5.00.py.

### **6. Unity Basics HTML/CSS Website Project**
- This project was made for my Website Design course at Cumberland University.
- The objective of this project was to showcase skills gained in HTML and CSS in the course.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects called iirizarry_IT325_11-3-21_Dijkstra_Algorithm_v5.00.py.

### **7. Python Side-Scrolling Game**
- This project was made for my Introduction to Programming course at Cumberland University.
- The objective of this project was to showcase skills gained in the class using Python.
- You will need to install the PyGame library to run this game. You will also need to keep the sprites in the same folder as the script.
- This project can be found under the College_Projects called iirizarry_IT_101_Game_Project_4-9-2024_v6.zip.

### **8. Ball Bouncer**
- This project was made as a practice project for Unity development for my Senior Capstone.
- It is a simple brick breaking game where the player tries to break all the blocks.
- The player has 3 tries before returning to the main menu.

# <u>Other Coding Projects (All in the Other_Coding_Projects branch)</u>

### **1. Command line Chess made using C++**
- This was a personal project to practice C++.
- It was written in C++ and has a person vs person (locally on the same PC) mode.
- The computer player's logic is very basic.

### **2. Crawler**
- Crawler is a simple arcade game that features 3 random bosses and continuous level generation.
- The game is top-down and 2D. The player must go through a near-infinite number of random rooms.
- Each room either contains one of the three bosses, or a chest that can help the player.
- Built using Python and can be found on https://arcade.thumby.us/ under the arcade tab. You can also run the code directly into the Thumby editor, make sure the two emulation buttons are checked, and press start to play. Please make sure to use Chrome or Edge.
